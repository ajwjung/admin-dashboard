# Admin Dashboard

## Objective

To create an admin dashboard to demonstrate understanding of CSS Grid. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

### Specifications

The image file in this repository called `dashboard-project.png` is the sample layout provided by TOP. Our dashboard does not need to be an exact replica, but the basic layout components must be present.

**Requirements:**

1. Use Grid to create the majority of the layout

2. The layout should include a sidebar, header, and main-content containers
    * Sidebar contains navigation and branding sections
    * Header contains a search bar, user info, and buttons
    * Main-content contains projects, announcements, and trending items

3. Use more grids to lay out each subsection

**Optional:**

1. Recreate the dashboard example or style your own design
    * You can choose your own color palettes, icons, and fonts

2. The page does not need to be responsive, but you can expand or shrink the project cards section when resizing the browser window if you'd like

## Author's Notes

This project was a fun way to practice creating grid layouts and using grid with flex. At times I got lost in the nested grids and couldn't figure out which items should also be grids, but eventually I sorted it out. Some of the solutions I found for the minor details I wanted to add were also neat to learn about. For example:

1. Using `z-index` on grid items to allow the `box-shadow` to show up (properly)

2. Using `filter` to change SVG icon colors ([StackOverflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22252472/how-to-change-the-color-of-an-svg-element))
